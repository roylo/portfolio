- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 with structured prompts and context management
- **Data Storage**: Structured JSON files in `/data/knowledge-base/` directory
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, and privacy controls
- **Performance**: <3 second response times with conversation history

### üì± User Experience
- Clean chat interface matching portfolio's dark/light theme design
- Floating chat button accessible from any page
- Dedicated `/chat` page for extended conversations
- Mobile-responsive design with smooth animations
- Conversation starters to guide user interactions

## Implementation Approach
