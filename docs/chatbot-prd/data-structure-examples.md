## Building Company Culture at BotBonnie

### Situation
When BotBonnie grew from 2 founders to 8 team members, I realized we had a culture problem. During a one-on-one, a usually quiet teammate asked me directly: "What is BotBonnie's company culture?" I didn't have a good answer, and I could see that morale was declining. That teammate eventually left, which was a wake-up call that I needed to be intentional about culture.

### Task
I needed to define and build an authentic company culture that would:
- Improve team retention and morale
- Create shared values and working principles
- Scale with our growing team
- Actually impact performance, not just be abstract concepts

### Actions
I treated this like a product experiment and implemented several initiatives:

1. **Teamwide Personality Interviews**: Added 15-20 minute sessions where all team members meet candidates, reducing future friction

2. **Quarterly External Speaker Sessions**: Invited industry experts to share perspectives and career insights

3. **Internal Book Clubs**: Created space for self-driven learning and collective growth

4. **Off-site Culture Workshops**: Had teammates reflect on past experiences and discuss ideal work cultures

5. **"Everyone is a Product Manager"**: Encouraged all teammates to create and own tasks, solve each other's blockers

6. **Focus on Problems, Not Blame**: Established that bugs/mistakes are learning opportunities, encouraging risk-taking

7. **Profit-sharing Program**: Aligned team incentives with company success

### Results
- **90%+ annual employee retention** in a high-churn market
- **85/100 score** in company-wide leadership survey
- **Defined 5 core values** through collaborative process: Freedom with responsibility, Energetic work, Creativity, Flexibility, Willingness to share
- **Sustainable culture framework** that scaled as we grew to 18 people

### Key Insights
- Culture can't be imposed top-down; it must be cultivated collaboratively
- Small, consistent experiments can have significant cultural impact
- Regular reflection and adjustment is essential for cultural evolution
- The investment in culture directly correlated with business performance

This experience taught me that culture isn't a "nice-to-have" - it's a competitive advantage that directly impacts retention, performance, and business outcomes.
```

### 3. General Conversation

**User Input:**
```
What makes Roy different from other product managers?
```

**AI Response:**
```
## What Makes Roy Unique as a Product Manager

### 1. Founder + Corporate Experience
- **Built from zero**: Co-founded and scaled BotBonnie from MVP to $X M ARR
- **Scaled at scale**: Led product lines contributing XX% of public company revenue at Appier
- This combination gives Roy both scrappy startup mindset and enterprise execution skills

### 2. AI/LLM Early Adopter
- Launched LLM features in 2023 achieving >50% enterprise adoption
- Led AI automation across multiple product lines
- Deep understanding of both AI capabilities and enterprise implementation challenges

### 3. Culture-First Leadership
- Intentionally built company culture that achieved 90% retention
- Believes in "everyone is a product manager" philosophy
- Proven ability to scale teams while maintaining culture (4 to 18 people at BotBonnie)

### 4. International Market Experience
- Successfully expanded into Japan, Korea, and SEA markets
- Cross-cultural team leadership experience
- Understanding of localization and market entry challenges

### 5. Full-Stack Business Perspective
- P&L ownership experience ($XX M revenue responsibility)
- Built and managed profitable business (75% gross margin at BotBonnie)
- Understands unit economics, not just feature development

### 6. Technical + Business Balance
- Engineering background (MS Computer Science, Valedictorian)
- 4+ years hands-on engineering before transitioning to product
- Can engage deeply with technical teams while driving business outcomes

**What This Means for Your Team:**
Roy brings both the strategic thinking of an experienced product leader and the hands-on execution skills of a founder. He's especially valuable for companies building AI products, expanding internationally, or looking to strengthen their product culture.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these differentiators or discuss how they might apply to a specific opportunity?
