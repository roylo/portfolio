Clients had to log into multiple platforms, reconfigure settings, and reconcile inconsistent data across tools like AIQUA and BotBonnie. This created a huge gap between what we promised and what we delivered—leading to poor product experience and low renewal intent.\n\nAt the same time, I saw a clear industry trend: brands were looking to unify first-party data and deliver personalized experiences across all channels—EDM, SMS, Web, App, and messaging platforms like LINE and WhatsApp. Appier had all the ingredients, but no one was owning the unification vision.\n\nAt the time, I was leading only the BotBonnie product line, with no authority over the other three product teams. Still, I felt responsible for fixing the fragmented user experience. My challenge was to build alignment across product, sales, and executive stakeholders—without formal ownership—and propose a vision that could influence company-wide roadmap and resources.\n\nFirst, I conducted over a dozen customer interviews and internal sessions with sales and customer success leaders to validate the pain points. I synthesized the findings into a three-year platform integration proposal that divided our products into two strategic pillars: **Personalization Cloud** (front-end orchestration) and **Data Cloud** (backend pipelines).\n\nI anticipated pushback around timing and resources, so I proposed a low-risk MVP: a **“Journey Map Builder”** that we could ship in 3 months using only my team. It offered clients a unified UI to design omnichannel campaigns and showcased what integration could look like.\n\nBefore going to the CEO, I aligned with our Chief Strategy Officer—incorporating his feedback and securing early buy-in. When I finally pitched to the CEO, I led with direct client quotes, market data, and a clear plan to phase the vision over time.\n\nThe CEO approved the plan in 15 minutes—and used my slides the next day at our company AMA. I was given cross-product authority to lead the initiative. Three months later, we launched the MVP, recovered **$300K ARR** from churn-risk clients, and received overwhelming feedback from sales and design teams.\n\nSix months later, I was promoted to **Senior Director**, overseeing both BotBonnie and AIQUA. Even after I left, the company continued to build on the same platform architecture I initiated—formally structuring the org around **Personalization Cloud** and **Data Cloud**.",

Our CEO preferred focusing on cross-product integration to support expansion in Japan.\n\nAs the product lead, I wanted to evaluate whether reprioritizing to Instagram would be a smarter strategic move—and if so, convince leadership to pivot the plan.\n\nI gathered data from multiple sources:\n\n*   Market reports showed Instagram had 50% market penetration in Japan—behind only LINE and YouTube\n    \n*   Internal sales call notes revealed we were losing deals in Japan to pricing competition, with little differentiation\n    \n*   No competitors were offering Instagram Messaging-based automation yet\n    \n*   Our engineers estimated we could launch an MVP in under one month\n    \n\nI synthesized these insights and proposed a shift in focus—launch Instagram automation first to create a differentiated market entry strategy, and use that traction to expand into broader platform integration later.\n\nThe CEO agreed to pivot. Within a month, we launched three marketing automation scenarios for Instagram and enabled the Japan sales team to go to market with something truly novel. The feedback was very positive—enterprise clients were excited to test new engagement strategies. Within a few months, we closed several key enterprise deals, establishing BotBonnie as an early mover in Japan.",

We had a tight three-month deadline. The engineering manager and I had broken down the MVP scope into tasks and asked each engineer to estimate their time.\n\nWhile the BotBonnie engineers gave estimates in line with expectations, one engineer from the other team estimated timelines that were 3x longer for tasks of similar complexity. During the planning meeting, he openly criticized the timeline as unrealistic and voiced strong resistance. This was more than just a difference in estimates—it revealed deeper cultural misalignment between teams.\n\nI first acknowledged his concerns and paused the meeting, promising to reassess the scope and timelines. The next day, I invited him to lunch outside office to understand his perspective.\n\nThrough the conversation, I learned his performance was evaluated heavily based on delivery completeness, lack of bugs, and timely execution—which made him risk-averse under our tight deadline. He worried that speed would come at the cost of quality.\n\nI shared the broader purpose of this MVP: to validate a new cross-product vision, demonstrate our ability to move fast, and rebuild trust with our executive team and customers. I emphasized that this was not about perfection, but velocity and iteration.\n\nTo support him, I made three commitments:\n\n1.  I spoke with his manager to align on performance criteria and assured him that I would take responsibility for risks during pilot testing.\n    \n2.  We re-scoped the MVP to separate “must-haves” from “nice-to-haves,” balancing ambition with feasibility.\n    \n3.  I promised to amplify the team’s impact and visibility, so their effort would be recognized beyond just delivery.\n    \n\nIn return, he agreed to re-evaluate the estimates with this new context and became an enthusiastic contributor to the team.\n\nWe successfully launched the MVP on time. During the beta phase, we recovered over $300K in ARR from churn-risk clients. Many leaders in the company, initially skeptical of our timeline, became strong supporters. I was later promoted to lead both product lines and continued scaling the platform.\n\nThis experience taught me that resolving conflict isn’t about “winning”—it’s about understanding what drives the other person and co-creating a shared goal.\n\nIt also reinforced my belief that building a high-performing team across different cultures requires more than just processes—it requires shared goals, psychological safety, and strong personal alignment.",

Most never published a bot. We needed to improve this flow to boost activation and retention.\n\nWe revisited our onboarding design and ran an A/B test.\n\nIn the new version, instead of having users go through multiple steps across different pages, we guided them to create a simple bot right inside the registration flow. They could select a channel, test the conversation, and publish—all within one screen and under three clicks per step.\n\nAlthough it slightly increased time spent in onboarding, the steps felt more goal-oriented and provided quicker feedback.\n\nThe new onboarding flow led to a 20% increase in bot publication, with no drop in registration completion.

They invested significant time and budget into the design and had high expectations, especially after seeing our previous success stories.\n\nThree days after launch, the client was furious. The campaign had far fewer user completions than expected. Most users dropped off after the first few messages, and the client claimed the product was misleading and poorly designed. They threatened to publicly discredit us and demanded compensation. As co-founder, I had to address their frustration, uncover the root cause, and prevent churn or reputational damage.\n\nFirst, I responded personally to acknowledge their disappointment, assured them we were taking this seriously, and immediately assigned our CS team to engage directly with the client. I also formed a small task-force team—myself, a PM, and an engineer—to investigate user behavior data.\n\nWithin a few hours, we found that poor conversation design caused user confusion and high drop-off. The core issues were:\n\n*   The client lacked guidance and didn’t know the best practice on how to structure a decision-tree chatbot.\n    \n*   Our product dashboard only reported final results, making it hard to detect UX bottlenecks.\n    \n*   Our internal systems didn’t flag high-profile clients using the self-service platform, so CS hadn’t proactively supported them.\n    \n\nThe next day, I made several decisions:\n\n1.  We created and promoted educational content on conversation design best practices across our customer channels.\n    \n2.  We ideated a heatmap-style visualization tool to help identify drop-off points in chatbot flows.\n    \n3.

I called the client directly to explain the findings, offered CS assistance to rebuild their flow, and shared our roadmap to address the gaps.\n    \n\nWhat started as a potential PR disaster turned into a long-term partnership. The client appreciated our transparency and follow-through, stayed with us, and later became one of our public success stories. Internally, the heatmap and account detection tools became key features that improved product quality and customer retention.\n\nThis experience taught me that difficult customers are often your most valuable. Their frustration is rarely random—it’s a signal that something deeper is broken. By responding with empathy, moving quickly, and thinking systemically, we not only saved the account but improved the product for everyone.",
