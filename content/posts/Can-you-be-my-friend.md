Today, during shower time with my daughter Abby, I had a heartwarming conversation that left me both amazed and inspired.

I casually asked Abby, “Who do you usually play with at school?” 
She lit up and started naming so many friends—many of them are from our MSx cohort’s children! 😊

Me: “Wow, you have a lot of friends!”
Abby: “Yes! Now I have friends from different countries, and I also have friends in Taiwan.”
Me: “That’s amazing! Can you teach Dad how to make friends too?”
Abby (with absolute confidence): “It’s easy! Just ask them, ‘Could you be my good friend?’ Some will say yes, and maybe some will say no, but no one has ever said no to me!”

Her answer stunned me. It was so simple, yet so profound.

As adults, we often overthink and overcomplicate things. Abby reminded me today that sometimes, all we need to do is just ask.
