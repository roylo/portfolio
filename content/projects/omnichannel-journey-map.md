## **AI-Powered Marketing Automation Across Channels**

At Appier, I led the **Omnichannel Journey Map** initiative, a next-gen marketing automation platform designed to unify customer engagement across SMS, email, web, app, and social messaging channels. This was part of a broader effort to transform Appier’s enterprise offerings with AI-driven personalization and automation.

**Key Highlights**

*   Initiated and led development across 3 product lines, aligning product vision, engineering, and GTM
    
*   Recovered $XXX K+ in at-risk annual recurring revenue during beta by solving major churn risk for key accounts
    
*   Built a cross-functional team of 8 and launched a scalable platform used by top enterprise clients
    
*   Created omnichannel campaign logic that improved conversion and re-engagement effectiveness
    
*   Set cross-team standards for system design, reducing development lead time by 25%
    

This project marked a pivotal shift for Appier’s product suite, positioning the company to deliver truly integrated, AI-enhanced marketing experiences at scale.
