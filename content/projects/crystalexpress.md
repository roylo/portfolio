## **High-Performance iOS Ad SDK for Mobile Video Monetization**

At Intowow, I led the development of iOS CrystalExpress, a lightweight SDK built to deliver native video ads instantly and at scale. The SDK was optimized for performance and seamless UX, powering monetization for major mobile publishers.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Engineered and launched the SDK from scratch within 3 months to meet key client deadlines
    
*   Delivered over **X** m HD video ads per day with near-zero latency
    
*   Boosted ad click-through rates by **xx%** through smart caching and rendering optimization
    
*   Successfully integrated with Taiwan’s #1 news app, serving millions of users daily
    

This project gave me hands-on experience balancing system performance, mobile UX, and business outcomes under aggressive timelines.
