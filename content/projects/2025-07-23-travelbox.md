## **Social Travel Planning App for Friends on Facebook**

TravelBox was a Facebook App I co-developed in grad school to make trip planning easier and more collaborative. It let friends co-create itineraries, share travel ideas, and document their journeys togetherâ€”all in one place.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Won **1st Place** in the 2009 CS Cup Campus Championship among 12 competing teams
    
*   Enabled users to invite friends, build shared travel plans, and post updates to Facebook timelines
    
*   Designed an intuitive interface that blended map views, schedules, and friend contributions
    
*   Served as an early exploration of social UX and real-time collaboration
    
*   Sparked my long-term interest in designing products that bring people together
    

This project showed me how thoughtful design and shared context can turn logistics into a fun, social experience.
