## **Gamification System for Yahoo! E-Commerce**

To boost seller engagement and loyalty, I co-designed the **E-Commerce Achievement Badge System**, a modular gamification layer for Yahoo’s marketplace. It rewarded users based on performance, behavior, and milestones, turning selling into a more motivating, game-like experience.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Won **Best EC Hack** at Yahoo! Taiwan 2012 Internal Hackday
    
*   Designed a flexible badge system rewarding milestones like sales volume, ratings, and customer service
    
*   Created backend logic and frontend display modules for dynamic badge rendering
    

This project combined my UX, product thinking, and engineering skills to create behavioral impact through smart incentives.
