## **Social Fitness App to Motivate Healthy Habits**

Fitribe was an iOS app I built and launched in just 3 months, designed to help users build consistent fitness habits through community-driven accountability. Inspired by the power of social motivation, the app combined gamification, habit tracking, and peer support to keep users engaged.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Launched MVP in **90 days** and iterated over 30 versions based on user feedback
    
*   Featured on the App Store as a top local creative app
    
*   Reached over **XXK** monthly active users (MAU)
    
*   Introduced a gamified unlock system that boosted engagement by 50%
    
*   Conducted 30+ user interviews to refine core features and monetization strategy
    

Fitribe was more than a fitness tracker. It was a tribe where people didn’t compete, but showed up for each other. This startup sharpened my skills in rapid prototyping, growth experimentation, and building sticky user experiences from zero to scale.
