## **Conversational Marketing Platform for Asiaâ€™s Leading Brands**

I co-founded BotBonnie to help businesses engage and convert customers through conversational experiences. We built an all-in-one chatbot platform for Facebook Messenger, LINE, Web, Instagram, Kakao Talk, and WhatsApp enabling marketers to launch interactive campaigns without writing code.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Bootstrapped the business to $X m+ annual recurring revenue with 75% gross margin
    
*   Served XXX+ enterprise clients including Audi, Uniqlo, and GSK across Asia
    
*   Personally led product, engineering, and go-to-market execution; built and launched the MVP
    
*   Selected by Facebook F8 as a global success case and recognized by Google Business Messages for product innovation
    
*   Scaled the team from 4 to 18 within 3 months onboarding; achieved 90%+ annual employee retention

BotBonnie empowered brands to turn chats into conversions. This journey honed my ability to ship enterprise SaaS, scale across markets, and build teams that move fast and learn faster.
