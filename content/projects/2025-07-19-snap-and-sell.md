## **30-Second Mobile Selling Experience — Yahoo! Hackday Winner**

Before Yahoo! launched its official mobile commerce app, I co-created **隨拍即賣**, a mobile-first concept that let users take a photo, auto-fill product details, and list it for sale—all in under 30 seconds.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Won **Best UX Hack** at Yahoo! Taiwan 2013 Internal Hackday
    
*   Designed intuitive flow: snap photo → auto-suggest title/category → list instantly
    
*   Eliminated friction for casual sellers, showing what mobile-first commerce could feel like
    
*   Inspired early-stage discussions around mobile UX for Yahoo Auctions
    
*   Prototyped with a full working demo in less than 48 hours
    

This project was a glimpse into the future of mobile e-commerce—simple, fast, and seller-centric.
