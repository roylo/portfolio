  title: Party Wall
  summary: Party Wall is a real-time photo wall app designed for events. Guests can instantly upload photos or tag the host’s Instagram account, with images appearing live on a big screen—perfect for parties and celebrations. I built this for my daughter’s 6th birthday to bring everyone into the moment.
