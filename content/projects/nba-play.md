title: NBA play plugin
summary: During the height of Linsanity, I built a Firefox plugin that delivered
  real-time NBA updates. It fetched live game data, pushed play-by-play
  notifications, displayed box scores, and linked to game highlights—all within
  the browser.

## **NBA Play-by-Play Notifier - Real-Time Browser Extension**

During the peak of Linsanity, I built a custom Firefox browser plugin that delivered **live NBA play-by-play updates** straight to the user’s desktop—before push notifications became mainstream.

### **Key Highlights**

*   Fetched real-time NBA game data and delivered in-browser notifications for every play
    
*   Enabled instant access to box scores, game highlights, and live updates
    
*   Built for hardcore fans to track games passively while multitasking
    
*   Developed fully in JavaScript with custom polling logic and notification API
    

This project was my early experiment in real-time UX and user delight.
