I was leading a cross-functional team to deliver the MVP of Journey Map within 3 months. The team included engineers from two very different product lines, each with their own working culture.

Early in planning, we encountered a major risk. One engineer estimated timelines that were 3x longer than others for similar tasks. He believed the timeline was unrealistic and feared it would compromise code quality—due to how his performance was measured, he was hesitant to cut corners or move fast.

I identified several risks: timeline delays, quality issues, team morale, and internal credibility.

To address them, I:

*   Took the time to understand the root cause behind his resistance by having a one-on-one lunch
    
*   Re-scoped the MVP to distinguish “must-have” and “nice-to-have” features
    
*   Spoke directly with his manager to align on evaluation expectations and assured I would take ownership of pilot-phase bugs
    
*   Reframed the goal of this MVP to focus on iteration speed and customer impact, not perfection
    
*   Positioned the project as high-impact to increase recognition and motivation across the team
    

We launched the MVP on time, recovered $300K in ARR from churn-risk customers, and earned strong support from execs who were initially skeptical.

The experience taught me that effective risk management requires not just tactical mitigation, but also empathy, communication, and cultural alignment.
