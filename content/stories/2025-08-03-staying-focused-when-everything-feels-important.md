When I’m managing multiple projects at once, I prioritize using a mix of **impact, urgency, dependencies, and strategic alignment**.

For example, at Appier, I was leading two product lines — one for marketing automation, the other for chatbot engagement — while also prototyping a new LLM-based Copilot.

To prioritize, I first aligned with leadership on the **non-negotiables** — for instance, a quarterly goal tied to increasing onboarding conversion had to be met. That made the Journey Map Builder a top priority.

Then I looked at **dependencies** — one feature blocked engineering work for another team, so I moved it up to avoid bottlenecks. I also reviewed **effort vs. impact**: some projects sounded exciting, like the LLM Copilot, but could be built as MVPs in two weeks to test demand.

Finally, I communicated openly with stakeholders to set expectations, and reallocated resources or paused lower-impact items.

This helped me stay focused on what truly moved the needle, rather than trying to do everything at once.
