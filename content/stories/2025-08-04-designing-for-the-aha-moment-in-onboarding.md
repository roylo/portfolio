At BotBonnie, we were trying to grow our North Star metric: the number of active chatbots published on the platform. We believed that if users quickly got into our visual no-code builder and started creating flows, they would hit their “aha” moment and stick around.

However, data from our onboarding funnel showed a sharp drop-off—many users were not completing key steps like designing a flow or connecting to messaging channels like Facebook or LINE. Most never published a bot. We needed to improve this flow to boost activation and retention.

We revisited our onboarding design and ran an A/B test.

In the new version, instead of having users go through multiple steps across different pages, we guided them to create a simple bot right inside the registration flow. They could select a channel, test the conversation, and publish—all within one screen and under three clicks per step.

Although it slightly increased time spent in onboarding, the steps felt more goal-oriented and provided quicker feedback.

The new onboarding flow led to a 20% increase in bot publication, with no drop in registration completion. It was a small but high-leverage improvement that helped more users reach meaningful product value faster.
