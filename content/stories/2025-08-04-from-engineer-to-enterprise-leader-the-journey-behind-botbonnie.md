My greatest professional success so far is building BotBonnie from the ground up, scaling it to $2M ARR, and eventually joining Appier through acquisition. But more than the business result, it’s the personal transformation and leadership growth that I’m most proud of.

When we started BotBonnie, I was still very much an engineer at heart—I loved building things. But as we grew, I realized that being a founder meant shifting from being a maker to being a strategist, team builder, and communicator.

I had to identify the right product-market fit, navigate competition, pitch investors and clients, and lead a cross-functional team through both failures and breakthroughs.

After being acquired by Appier, I stayed on and helped integrate BotBonnie into a broader enterprise suite. That came with its own set of challenges: adapting to a different company culture, building credibility internally, and helping my team thrive in a new environment. Over time, I earned the trust to drive platform strategy across two product lines, and helped scale the solution into markets like Japan and Korea.

Looking back, the most meaningful part isn’t the acquisition or the ARR. It’s seeing team members grow into new leadership roles, seeing our product evolve into part of a public company’s long-term roadmap, and knowing that the vision we started with is still creating value years later.
