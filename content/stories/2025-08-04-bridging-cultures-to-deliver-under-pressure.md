When I led the MVP development of Journey Map at Appier, I formed a new cross-functional team with engineers from two different product lines—BotBonnie (my original team) and another internal product group. We had a tight three-month deadline. The engineering manager and I had broken down the MVP scope into tasks and asked each engineer to estimate their time.

While the BotBonnie engineers gave estimates in line with expectations, one engineer from the other team estimated timelines that were 3x longer for tasks of similar complexity. During the planning meeting, he openly criticized the timeline as unrealistic and voiced strong resistance. This was more than just a difference in estimates—it revealed deeper cultural misalignment between teams.

I first acknowledged his concerns and paused the meeting, promising to reassess the scope and timelines. The next day, I invited him to lunch outside office to understand his perspective.

Through the conversation, I learned his performance was evaluated heavily based on delivery completeness, lack of bugs, and timely execution—which made him risk-averse under our tight deadline. He worried that speed would come at the cost of quality.

I shared the broader purpose of this MVP: to validate a new cross-product vision, demonstrate our ability to move fast, and rebuild trust with our executive team and customers. I emphasized that this was not about perfection, but velocity and iteration.

To support him, I made three commitments:

1.  I spoke with his manager to align on performance criteria and assured him that I would take responsibility for risks during pilot testing.
    
2.  We re-scoped the MVP to separate “must-haves” from “nice-to-haves,” balancing ambition with feasibility.
    
3.  I promised to amplify the team’s impact and visibility, so their effort would be recognized beyond just delivery.
    

In return, he agreed to re-evaluate the estimates with this new context and became an enthusiastic contributor to the team.

We successfully launched the MVP on time. During the beta phase, we recovered over $300K in ARR from churn-risk clients. Many leaders in the company, initially skeptical of our timeline, became strong supporters. I was later promoted to lead both product lines and continued scaling the platform.

This experience taught me that resolving conflict isn’t about “winning”—it’s about understanding what drives the other person and co-creating a shared goal.

It also reinforced my belief that building a high-performing team across different cultures requires more than just processes—it requires shared goals, psychological safety, and strong personal alignment.
