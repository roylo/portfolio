One time I had a disagreement with my manager was at Appier, when I was leading product strategy across multiple regional markets.

Our Korea sales leader was pushing hard to prioritize a product request for the Korean market. However, based on our existing roadmap and engineering capacity, I had already communicated — both to him and our CEO — that this would need to wait until the following quarter. The prioritization wasn’t arbitrary; it was aligned with overall business goals and agreed upon with leadership.

However, the sales leader felt I was deprioritizing Korea and escalated the issue to the CEO, who then asked me to apologize and try to resolve the situation.

I was initially very frustrated — from my perspective, I had been transparent and collaborative the whole time. I also worried that this would set a precedent that complaints could override product strategy.

But after cooling down, I tried to understand the bigger picture. The CEO wasn’t necessarily questioning my decision-making, but wanted to maintain momentum in Korea, which was one of our most promising markets.

So I proactively scheduled a call with the Korea sales leader. I acknowledged the misalignment in expectations, explained the roadmap again, and offered a compromise: we’d begin the **requirement scoping process early**, and **join any client-facing meetings** to support their pitches.

This helped rebuild trust, and Korea went on to deliver strong sales that quarter — even before the product was fully delivered.

It reminded me that sometimes leadership isn’t about being right — it’s about **balancing principles with diplomacy**, and finding solutions that move the business forward.
