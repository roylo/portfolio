One of the most painful but valuable failures in my career happened during the early days of BotBonnie.

We were growing fast, had just launched several successful campaigns, and were about to work with a major client — Audi. Under pressure, I urgently needed a project manager to help manage this high-stakes engagement.

We found a candidate with a strong academic background and banking project management experience. While I noticed a slight mismatch in mindset and culture fit, I ignored my instinct due to time pressure and hired him.

Unfortunately, the result was disastrous. His work was often sloppy, he resisted feedback, and his confrontational attitude disrupted team morale. Over three months, his presence negatively affected the team to the point where we two originally strong members were started to work like him. Eventually, I had to let him go and personally explain the situation to Audi — which was not easy.

That experience taught me a critical lesson: **in a startup, one bad hire can cost you far more than just productivity — it can affect team culture, trust, and momentum.**

Since then, I’ve treated hiring as one of the most important decisions a founder makes. I invested in a more structured hiring process, involving team fit interviews, values alignment, and trial tasks. As a result, we gradually built a high-performing team that truly shared our vision.
