# The Challenge

When BotBonnie grew from 2 founders to 8 team members, I realized we had a culture problem. During a one-on-one, a usually quiet teammate asked me directly: "What is BotBonnie's company culture?" I didn't have a good answer, and I could see that morale was declining. That teammate eventually left, which was a wake-up call that I needed to be intentional about culture.

At that time, the overall morale hit a low point. I even started questioning the meaning of my own work. Company culture became an unsolvable puzzle in my mind, something like an NP-hard problem, as us nerdy engineers would say.

# What I Had to Do

I needed to define and build an authentic company culture that would:

*   Improve team retention and morale
*   Create shared values and working principles
*   Scale with our growing team
*   Actually impact performance, not just be abstract concepts

# My Approach

I treated this like a product experiment and implemented several initiatives over the course of a year:

## 1\. Teamwide Personality Interviews

*   Added 15-20 minute sessions where all team members meet candidates
*   Helped both sides understand each other better
*   Reduced future friction when working together

## 2\. Quarterly External Speaker Sessions

*   Invited industry experts to speak to the team
*   Gave us fresh perspectives and career path insights
*   Rare chance to see how different roles achieve success

## 3\. Internal Book Clubs

*   Launched reading groups encouraging everyone to participate
*   Led discussions and shared takeaways
*   Created space for self-driven learning and collective growth

## 4\. Off-site Culture Workshops

*   Organized sessions where teammates reflected on past experiences
*   Discussed ideal work cultures in small groups
*   Simple sessions that helped us understand each other and align

## 5\. "Everyone is a Product Manager"

*   Encouraged teammates to create and own tasks
*   Anyone could raise important problems
*   Solving each other's blockers became top priority

## 6\. Focus on Problems, Not Blame

*   Bugs and mistakes are inevitable in software
*   Focus always on fixing issues and preventing recurrence
*   Encouraged risk-taking and owned outcomes together

## 7\. Profit-sharing Program

*   Portion of platform revenue went to company-wide bonuses
*   Growth recognized as team effort
*   Every role contributed to outcomes

# The Results

The results were impressive and measurable:

*   **90%+ annual employee retention** in a high-churn market
*   **85/100 score** in company-wide leadership survey
*   **5 core values defined** through collaborative process:
    *   Freedom with responsibility
    *   Energetic and joyful work
    *   Creativity
    *   Flexibility and openness to change
    *   Willingness to share
*   **Sustainable culture framework** that scaled as we grew to 18 people
*   **Team grew from 8 to 18** in 2 years with less than 3-month onboarding ramp

# Key Insights

This experience taught me several crucial lessons:

*   Culture can't be imposed top-down; it must be cultivated collaboratively
*   Small, consistent experiments can have significant cultural impact
*   Regular reflection and adjustment is essential for cultural evolution
*   The investment in culture directly correlated with business performance
*   A team that is aligned and united delivers the best results for customers

The job of the torchbearer is not necessarily to illuminate the one correct path, but to ignite flames in the hearts of others. With more torches lit, we can explore more paths together.
