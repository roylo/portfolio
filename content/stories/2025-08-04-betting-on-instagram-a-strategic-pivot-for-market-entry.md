When Facebook released the Instagram Messaging API, we were debating whether to pause our ongoing product roadmap to prioritize Instagram automation. Our CEO preferred focusing on cross-product integration to support expansion in Japan.

As the product lead, I wanted to evaluate whether reprioritizing to Instagram would be a smarter strategic move—and if so, convince leadership to pivot the plan.

I gathered data from multiple sources:

*   Market reports showed Instagram had 50% market penetration in Japan—behind only LINE and YouTube
    
*   Internal sales call notes revealed we were losing deals in Japan to pricing competition, with little differentiation
    
*   No competitors were offering Instagram Messaging-based automation yet
    
*   Our engineers estimated we could launch an MVP in under one month
    

I synthesized these insights and proposed a shift in focus—launch Instagram automation first to create a differentiated market entry strategy, and use that traction to expand into broader platform integration later.

The CEO agreed to pivot. Within a month, we launched three marketing automation scenarios for Instagram and enabled the Japan sales team to go to market with something truly novel. The feedback was very positive—enterprise clients were excited to test new engagement strategies. Within a few months, we closed several key enterprise deals, establishing BotBonnie as an early mover in Japan.
