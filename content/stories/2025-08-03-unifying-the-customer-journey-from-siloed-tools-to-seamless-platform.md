After Appier acquired my startup BotBonnie, I began sitting in on cross-functional sales pitches and noticed a recurring issue: while we marketed an end-to-end marketing solution, our products were siloed. Clients had to log into multiple platforms, reconfigure settings, and reconcile inconsistent data across tools like AIQUA and BotBonnie. This created a huge gap between what we promised and what we delivered—leading to poor product experience and low renewal intent.

At the same time, I saw a clear industry trend: brands were looking to unify first-party data and deliver personalized experiences across all channels—EDM, SMS, Web, App, and messaging platforms like LINE and WhatsApp. Appier had all the ingredients, but no one was owning the unification vision.

At the time, I was leading only the BotBonnie product line, with no authority over the other three product teams. Still, I felt responsible for fixing the fragmented user experience. My challenge was to build alignment across product, sales, and executive stakeholders—without formal ownership—and propose a vision that could influence company-wide roadmap and resources.

First, I conducted over a dozen customer interviews and internal sessions with sales and customer success leaders to validate the pain points. I synthesized the findings into a three-year platform integration proposal that divided our products into two strategic pillars: **Personalization Cloud** (front-end orchestration) and **Data Cloud** (backend pipelines).

I anticipated pushback around timing and resources, so I proposed a low-risk MVP: a **“Journey Map Builder”** that we could ship in 3 months using only my team. It offered clients a unified UI to design omnichannel campaigns and showcased what integration could look like.

Before going to the CEO, I aligned with our Chief Strategy Officer—incorporating his feedback and securing early buy-in. When I finally pitched to the CEO, I led with direct client quotes, market data, and a clear plan to phase the vision over time.

The CEO approved the plan in 15 minutes—and used my slides the next day at our company AMA. I was given cross-product authority to lead the initiative. Three months later, we launched the MVP, recovered **$300K ARR** from churn-risk clients, and received overwhelming feedback from sales and design teams.

Six months later, I was promoted to **Senior Director**, overseeing both BotBonnie and AIQUA. Even after I left, the company continued to build on the same platform architecture I initiated—formally structuring the org around **Personalization Cloud** and **Data Cloud**.
