In 2017, one of our most high-profile brand clients used our chatbot platform to launch a major Messenger campaign. They invested significant time and budget into the design and had high expectations, especially after seeing our previous success stories.

Three days after launch, the client was furious. The campaign had far fewer user completions than expected. Most users dropped off after the first few messages, and the client claimed the product was misleading and poorly designed. They threatened to publicly discredit us and demanded compensation. As co-founder, I had to address their frustration, uncover the root cause, and prevent churn or reputational damage.

First, I responded personally to acknowledge their disappointment, assured them we were taking this seriously, and immediately assigned our CS team to engage directly with the client. I also formed a small task-force team—myself, a PM, and an engineer—to investigate user behavior data.

Within a few hours, we found that poor conversation design caused user confusion and high drop-off. The core issues were:

*   The client lacked guidance and didn’t know the best practice on how to structure a decision-tree chatbot.
    
*   Our product dashboard only reported final results, making it hard to detect UX bottlenecks.
    
*   Our internal systems didn’t flag high-profile clients using the self-service platform, so CS hadn’t proactively supported them.
    

The next day, I made several decisions:

1.  We created and promoted educational content on conversation design best practices across our customer channels.
    
2.  We ideated a heatmap-style visualization tool to help identify drop-off points in chatbot flows.
    
3.  We enhanced our internal dashboard to automatically flag high-value self-service accounts, enabling proactive CS outreach.
    
4.  I called the client directly to explain the findings, offered CS assistance to rebuild their flow, and shared our roadmap to address the gaps.
    

What started as a potential PR disaster turned into a long-term partnership. The client appreciated our transparency and follow-through, stayed with us, and later became one of our public success stories. Internally, the heatmap and account detection tools became key features that improved product quality and customer retention.

This experience taught me that difficult customers are often your most valuable. Their frustration is rarely random—it’s a signal that something deeper is broken. By responding with empathy, moving quickly, and thinking systemically, we not only saved the account but improved the product for everyone.
