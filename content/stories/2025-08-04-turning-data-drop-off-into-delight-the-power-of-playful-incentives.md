One example that comes to mind was during my time at BotBonnie, a chatbot marketing platform I co-founded. We worked with brands to create interactive campaigns that collected user preferences through button-based flows.

I noticed a consistent issue: many users dropped off before completing these flows, which meant incomplete data for brands and poor campaign performance.

I realized the core problem was a lack of value exchange — we were asking users to give information without offering anything fun or engaging in return. So I proposed a creative solution: what if we could generate **personalized visual rewards** based on user input? Something they’d actually want to share or use.

I worked with our engineers to develop a lightweight image generation module that could dynamically create visuals using users’ choices and attributes, such as their name or selected items. One standout example was a campaign we ran with Shopee and Burger King in Taiwan.

Users built their own burger by selecting ingredients through a chatbot. At the end, we generated a **custom burger image** for them — which they could either share on social media or **redeem at Burger King for a real custom burger**.

The results were huge: **hundreds of thousands of users participated**, with an **85% completion rate** and **30% social sharing**. More importantly, what started as a one-off idea evolved into one of our **most profitable and reusable product modules** — engineers could set it up in 30 minutes, and it brought in thousands of dollars in recurring revenue per campaign.

This experience taught me that innovation doesn’t always require cutting-edge technology — sometimes it’s about rethinking incentives and creating delightful moments that users _want_ to complete and share.
