In 2021, we were renewing our multi-year partnership with Audi, one of BotBonnie’s first and most iconic enterprise clients. We had worked with them for three years, and they were a big part of our early success story.

But that year, our main contact at Audi left the company, and a new Taiwan GM came in. The renewal discussions became rocky. A competitor came in aggressively with much lower pricing and an unrealistic delivery timeline. We evaluated it carefully and knew that matching their offer would be unsustainable for us. Still, we tried to engage the client, explain the tradeoffs, and express our strong interest in continuing the partnership.

Despite our effort, Audi chose the competitor. It was a tough blow—not only did we lose a key client, but internally, it felt like a personal loss. I gathered the team, and instead of blaming the outcome, we held a postmortem to analyze what went wrong—things like overreliance on a single contact, lack of multi-threading in the relationship, and a need to reframe how we communicated long-term value in a competitive deal.

We focused our energy on supporting the handoff professionally and doubling down on product innovation to strengthen our positioning.

Unexpectedly, about three months later, Audi reached back out. The competitor had missed deadlines and overpromised. We were invited back in and eventually signed a new deal, regaining their trust.

But more importantly, the failure taught me not to take customer loyalty for granted, and that even in loss, your professionalism and long-term value can leave a lasting impression.
